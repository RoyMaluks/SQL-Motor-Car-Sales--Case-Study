💡 Key Findings

Total revenue exceeds R8 billion across the dataset

Tuesday–Thursday drive the highest revenue

February is the strongest month, while April and July have zero or very low revenue

Vehicle sales are dominated by Low Margin units (479K)

Automatic transmissions far outperform manual

Several brands show negative price differences, meaning vehicles were sold below market value

Missing values in brand, model, trim, condition, and transmission indicate data quality issues

🚀 Conclusion

The analysis reveals strong weekday sales performance, brand-driven revenue, and opportunities to improve pricing strategy and data accuracy.
To strengthen overall performance, Bright Motors should consider:

Improving weekend sales engagement

Addressing pricing gaps between market value and selling price

Enhancing data capturing processes across dealerships

Increasing stock for high-performing brands

Running margin-based promotional strategies

These insights support better decision-making and offer a clear path toward improved profitability and operational efficiency.
